<h1>About this Cousin It site: sources, scope, and standards</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Our mission: make Cousin It information easy to verify</h2>
<p>Cousin It is an independent reference site dedicated to documenting the history, character traits, voice actors, and cultural impact of Cousin Itt—one of the most recognizable figures from The Addams Family franchise. Our mission is to provide clear, accurate, and verifiable information for an international audience of fans, researchers, costume enthusiasts, and pop culture historians.</p>

<p>We are not affiliated with any official Addams Family rights holder, studio, or production company. Instead, we operate as a fan-driven educational resource that respects the creative legacy of cartoonist Charles Addams and the many adaptations that have brought Cousin Itt to life across television, film, and animation since the 1960s.</p>

<p>The Addams Family franchise spans multiple decades and formats—from the original 1960s television series to feature films, animated series, and recent streaming adaptations. Each version presents Cousin Itt with slight variations in appearance, voice, and personality. Rather than claiming one "correct" version, we document these differences transparently and encourage readers to explore primary sources and authoritative references.</p>

<p>Our tone is educational and supportive. We understand that visitors arrive with different levels of familiarity—some may be planning a <strong>Cousin It Halloween costume</strong>, others researching <strong>Cousin It character history</strong> for academic or journalistic purposes, and still others simply curious about why this all-hair character has endured in popular culture. We write for all of these audiences without assuming prior knowledge or using insider jargon.</p>

<p>We serve an international readership, which means we use British English spelling and grammar conventions, avoid region-specific references unless contextually necessary, and link to globally accessible sources such as Wikipedia, Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Library of Congress, and major international news outlets like the BBC.</p>

<p>Transparency is central to our approach. When information varies by adaptation—such as who voiced Cousin Itt in a particular film or series—we state this clearly rather than presenting a single answer as universal. When a detail is uncertain, speculative, or based on fan interpretation rather than documented fact, we label it as such. This commitment to clarity helps readers assess the reliability of the information and pursue further research with confidence.</p>

<p>If you are new to the character, we recommend starting with our <a href="/">main Cousin It guide</a>, which covers the character's origins, signature traits, and role within the Addams Family ensemble. For quick answers to common questions—such as <em>who is Cousin It</em>, <em>what is Cousin It's real name</em>, or <em>how to make a Cousin It costume</em>—visit our <a href="/faq">FAQ page</a>.</p>

<h2>Editorial standards and update policy</h2>

<h3>What we consider a reliable source</h3>
<p>We prioritize primary sources, archival materials, and reputable reference works when documenting facts about Cousin Itt and the Addams Family franchise. This includes official production credits, interviews with creators and performers published by established news organizations, and entries in peer-reviewed or editorially supervised encyclopedias.</p>

<p>Examples of sources we consult include the Library of Congress for materials related to Charles Addams, Encyclopaedia Britannica for general reference and historical context, Wikipedia for broad overviews and cross-referencing (while verifying claims against its own citations), and major entertainment journalism outlets such as the BBC, The Guardian, and Variety for production news and cast interviews.</p>

<p>When a claim is adaptation-specific—for instance, the voice actor for Cousin Itt in the 2019 animated film versus the 1964 television series—we cite the relevant source and make the distinction explicit. We do not present fan theories, unverified anecdotes, or speculative interpretations as established fact, though we may discuss them when they illuminate the character's cultural reception or influence.</p>

<p>If we cannot locate a reliable source for a widely repeated claim, we note the gap and invite readers to contact us with documentation. Our goal is not to be exhaustive, but to be accurate and transparent about what is known, what is uncertain, and where readers can verify details independently.</p>

<h3>How we use keywords without stuffing</h3>
<p>Search engine optimization is important for helping people find accurate information, but we never sacrifice readability or clarity for keyword density. Terms such as <strong>Cousin It Addams Family</strong>, <strong>Cousin It character history</strong>, <strong>Cousin It voice actor</strong>, and <strong>Cousin It costume ideas</strong> appear naturally in our content at a density of approximately one to two percent—enough to signal relevance to search engines, but not so much that the text becomes repetitive or awkward.</p>

<p>We write for human readers first. If a keyword phrase does not fit naturally into a sentence, we rephrase the sentence or use a synonym rather than forcing the phrase in. Our editorial standard is that every page should be comfortable to read aloud, and that a visitor unfamiliar with SEO practices should never notice that keywords are being targeted.</p>

<p>We also recognize that different audiences use different terms. Some search for "Cousin It," others for "Cousin Itt" (the more common official spelling), and still others for phrases like "Addams Family hair character" or "who is the hairy guy in Addams Family." We accommodate this variation by using multiple phrasings naturally throughout our content and by providing clear explanations early in each page.</p>

<section id="contact">
<h2>Contact and corrections</h2>
<p>We welcome corrections, clarifications, and suggestions for additional sources. If you believe we have made an error or omitted an important detail, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@cousinit.org">hello@cousinit.org</a> with a brief description of the issue and, if possible, a link to a reliable source that supports your correction.</p>

<p>We review all submissions and aim to respond within two weeks. If we make a substantive correction, we will note the update at the bottom of the relevant page along with the date. Minor corrections (such as typos or formatting issues) are made silently.</p>

<p>We do not operate a comments section or forum, as our focus is on maintaining a small, high-quality reference site rather than hosting community discussion. However, we encourage readers to share and discuss our content on social media, in fan communities, and in academic or journalistic work—provided that sources are cited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you share a Cousin It fact, share the source too—context keeps pop culture history accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We believe that good research is collaborative and cumulative. By citing sources and acknowledging uncertainty, we hope to model a approach to pop culture documentation that values accuracy, transparency, and respect for the creative work that makes characters like Cousin Itt so enduring.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting Cousin It. Whether you are here to plan a costume, settle a trivia question, or explore the character's place in television history, we hope you find the information clear, useful, and easy to verify.</p>
